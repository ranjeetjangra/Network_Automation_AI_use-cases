BGP Link Maestro
## Description	
This provides a solution to manage the configuration of BGP links. The product aims to create new Transit, Peering Private, and Peering Public link types.

## Tagline
BGP Link Maestro-Effortless BGP Link Control
## Vision
The product vision is OPEX (Operational Expenses) reduction. By automating BGP link configuration, this product aims to reduce the manual effort and associated costs involved in managing BGP links across various network devices.
## Target Users
Configuration Management and Operations Team
## Problems Solved
BGP links can exist in multiple network devices and are required to follow specific configuration templates. The current manual process for configuring these links is time-consuming and prone to errors.
## Magic Factor
The solution uses NSO (Network Service Orchestrator) as the main orchestrator and SPIS (Service Provider Integration Services) as the main user portal. Dry-run outputs are shown for validation and approval before any configuration is pushed to the network
