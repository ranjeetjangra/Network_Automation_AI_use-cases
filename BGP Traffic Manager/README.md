## Use Case	
BGP Optimisation
## Product Name	
BGP Traffic Manager
## Description	
Product Description: This solution manages traffic on BGP links to reduce congestion and balance traffic distribution across links. It achieves this by identifying congested BGP interfaces and recommending traffic shifts to non-congested interfaces. This is achieved by de-announcing specific prefixes from congested interfaces and announcing them on target interfaces
## Tagline
Intelligent Traffic Steering for Optimal BGP Performance
## Vision
To automate the identification and resolution of BGP traffic issues, contributing to operational cost reduction (OPEX) and improved network performance.
## Target Users
Configuration Management and Operations Team
## Problems Solved
1. BGP Link Congestion: Addresses congestion issues arising from outages or suboptimal BGP advertisement.
2. Manual Optimization Complexity: Automates a process that is manually complex and time-consuming.
3. Lack of End-to-End Visibility: Provides a comprehensive view of peering link utilisation for informed decision-making.
## Magic Factor
The product's automation capability provides a proactive and efficient approach to BGP optimization, eliminating manual intervention and significantly reducing time to resolution. This is not from the source and you may want to independently verify this information.
## Top Core Features
1. Automated Traffic Shifting: Automatically de-announces prefixes from congested interfaces and announces them on non-congested ones.
2. Manual and Closed-Loop Triggers: Allows for user-initiated optimization or automated closed-loop optimization.
3. Support for Multiple Link Types: Offers optimization logic for Transit, Peering Private, and Peering Public links.
4. Network Topology Representation: Visualizes network topology for easy understanding of link relationships and traffic flow.
5. Link Utilisation Dashboard: Provides real-time insights into link utilization for monitoring and decision support.
6. Prefix Traffic Dashboard: Monitors traffic per prefix on BGP links for granular analysis.
7. Dry-Run Functionality: Allows users to test optimization actions before implementing them in the network.
